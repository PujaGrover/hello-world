# hello-world
hello-world repository is my first project at CoderGirlWinter 2019 C# Cohort. It is a place where we can store ideas, resources or even share and discuss things with others
I am Puja and I'm very new to coding and GitHub. This is my first commit and will see how we can use this to edit our own codes or codes shared with others. Looking forward to getting comfortable doing this.
